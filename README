TRANSACTION DELIVERY
**********************************************************************
Requirements:
    a. MySQL server 5.x installed and configured.
    b. transactionQueueDB schema running on MySQL server.
    c. Java SDK 1.6.0_37
    d. Maven 3.0.x installed.

Installation:
    2. Make sure that “database.properties” file matches your database configuration.
    3. Also make sure to check “email.properties” file, in order to allow the application send emails from and to an
    email account. For testing purposes you can use a gmail account for the from email account.
    4. After that you should be ready to package the TransactionDelivery. To do it you should go to the terminal console
     and under the folder “transactionDelivery” you must run the following commands:
        - $mvn clean
        - $mvn package
    5.	If execution of the above processes are successful, a “target” folder will be created under
    transactionDelivery folder.
    6.	Assuming you are still on “transactionDelivery ” folder run the following command in order to run
    TransactionDelivery:
        - $java –jar target/TransactionDelivery.one-jar.jar
    7. In order to manually package a tarball file for production we must keep the following file structure:
        - transactionDelivery (Folder)
                |
                |__ target (Folder)
                |
                |__ TransactionDelivery.one-jar.jar (Jar file)

       Then you will be able to execute jar file as in previous step:
        - $ java –jar target/TransactionDelivery.one-jar.jar
    8. At this point TransactionDelivery will retrieve data from transactionQueueDB, READY/FAILURE transactions, will be
     send via SMTP, to email defined on step 2.c.
